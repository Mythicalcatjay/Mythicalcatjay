### Hello there! I'm a hobbyist coder so be prepared for my code to look bad to put it politely. 
### I'm working on all of my Neocities sites as needed as well as looking into starting up a Renp'y project. 
### I'm much better at art than coding though, I suggest going to my YouTube channel if you want some level of quality and it will link to my other artsy socials.
### You can check out my main websites here:
